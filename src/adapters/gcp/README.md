# Google Cloud Platform Adapters

This directory includes adapters for services found on the Google Cloud Platform.

To authorize these calls locally you must set your GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS pointed to the full path of a service account JSON file.

Deploying as a Google Cloud Function will take on the permissions of the service account assigned.

Currently, these adapters do not support running in any other environment.
